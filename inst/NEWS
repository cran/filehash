Version 0.4
-----------

* Added name mangling scheme to prevent clobbering on case-insensitive
OSes like Windows (thanks to Bill Venables and David Brahm)

* Added dumpImage, dumpObjects, dumpDF functions for dumping various
things to filehash databases

* Added filehashOption() function for setting global options; right
now only the default database type can be set

* dbLoad and db2env are regular functions now rather than
generics/methods.  dbLoad's default 'env' is the parent frame now

* Added a "filehash" method for 'with'

* Added new generic dbUnlink which deletes a database from the disk
